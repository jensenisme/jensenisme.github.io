Congratulations to my brilliant and beautiful wife on graduating with a degree in supply chain and logistics. Working full time and going to school is so very challenging and time consuming, but Mara stayed the course and finished with honors. Her hardwork and endurance is inspiring. I'm lucky to have such a badass wife.
