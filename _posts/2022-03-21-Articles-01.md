Let's not dwell on how long it's been since I've written anything here.  I read the above article this afternoon during lunch and found it insightful if challenging. My initial thoughts on the global response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as a complete layman, was positive. Surely this is globalization working. It's an optimistic though myopic opinion. 

Midway through the article, as I found myself persuaded in some points, I felt that nagging question "Wait, before I get invested... who is this guy?" The article is in Foreign Affairs which I've come to respect, but the author is Adam S. Posen  and I had no idea about him. Mr. Posen (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Posen) is  president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (https://www.piie.com) an American economic think tank. Neat.
