# Dudley on Keys!

![Dudley on keys!](/images/Dudley/dudley.gif)

It's been too long since I've seen my friend Alex. Last night we had the wonderful opportunity to spend time talking outside Pho Cao with him and his delightful wife Jessica, and then the extra benefit of watching him play in a band with some of his talented co-workers. It was an evening long overdue, and I could not have had a better time. It is good to have old friends, and even better to have good old friends.
