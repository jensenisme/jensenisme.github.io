I can't believe this is the first time I've written here in 2020. It's not as though I haven't had time, or things to say. Of course, now that I'm here at the keyboard I don't really think I need to say them. It all boils down more or less to why are people so collectively stupid and mean? In that order. Mara and I have been OK. We've had some really scary moments where we worried for our jobs. Things have seemed to stabilize and we have some good news. We're buying a house. After years of bouncing around as renters, we're going to own a home. I'm incredibly excited. 2020 can mostly suck it, but this is wonderful.
