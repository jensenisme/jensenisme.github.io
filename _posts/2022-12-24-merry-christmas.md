It's Christmas again. 12:01AM, people are shooting off fireworks, or trying to shootdown Santa, but I know I'm not the only one awake.

The world is a mess. If there's a place that isn't, please send me an invitation. If this is a simulation, reboot. Otherwise, enjoy time with the ones you love and forget the madness a moment. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
