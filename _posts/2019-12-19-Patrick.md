My good friend Patrick is an excellent poet, and this year he self published a collection of his poems in a volume titled _West of House_. Even if I disliked him I would have to admit that I enjoyed his book, and secretly dislike him more in envy of his talent. And, while I do envy his talent, I do not like dislike him in the least and am quite proud to know him. If you enjoy poetry, please do check it out. Read a sample on his blog and make his day with a purchase if you like it:
