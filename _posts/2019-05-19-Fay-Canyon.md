# Fay Canyon Trail

For a little over a month, Mara and I have been exercising and eating healthier. While losing weight is a goal, it's also part of an overall ambition to change our lifestyle. For me, the mental benefits were apparent more quickly than the physical. After just a week of going to the gym and eating more fruits and vegetables I noticed:

* Feeling less depressed
* Feeling less lethargic
* Feeling less anxiety
* Easier to wake up each morning.

Mara also saw benefits, and we decided to chase this high. We take weekends off from the gym, but decided we should try to make our weekends more active - perhaps less time in front of TVs and computers, and less time just out shopping and not really doing much. I grew up hiking and camping with my family, and Mara's folks have grown to be avid hikers in recent years - so hiking it was.

Our first hike (and second as of this writing) was [Fay Canyon Trail.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/arizona/fay-canyon-trail) An admittedly easy, but perfect for our first foray, trail just a little outside Sedona.

You'll note, if you can read it, the sign says "End of *maintained* trail." There's apparently a lovely view as a reward if you press on through some more rough terrain. Our goal is once we feel more experienced, to press on beyond this sign and check out that view.

This weekend, we'd intended to hit up West Fork trail, but after some poor planning and the pressure of being on a timeline we ended up just doing Fay Canyon again. I say "just" but it was an amazing time and just as beautiful as the first outing. I love this trail. Next up though is definitely West Fork. I've been once before years ago as a kid, and I'm eager to return. I think we've got ourselves a new hobby.
