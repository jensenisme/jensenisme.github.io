![We love you, Edgar](/images/edgar/edgar.jpg)

Today we said goodbye to Edgar. The first dog I ever had on my own, and a member of the family. He was a sweetheart, but also a neurotic weirdo and for that we loved him even more. He and Mara shared a particularly special bond. Edgar had a natural distrust of new humans, but he and Mara were fast friends over snacks. He was her buddy. He would wake with her each morning, prancing and spinning excitedly to start the day, particularly with breakfast. Half asleep I'd here them going down the hall, Mara saying good morning and asking if he was ready for food. Wherever she was, he was. Lately she's been in her office with both school and work going on, and sometimes I'd hear her talking to him. Asking him how he was, giving his bad back a massage. 

A couple years ago a vet made it clear he was on borrowed time with his back. We grieved even as we hoped he recovered. When he did, we were elated but we also watched closely for signs of pain, difficulty walking. That he made it this long seems a bit of a miracle and yet it still felt too soon. We knew it was time, though. The last few days he hadn't gotten up with Mara, and this morning was worse. It's easy to imagine he would have kept on in pain if we asked him to. It's hard not to be selfish, to not hold on for our own sakes. But we both sat with him, cried with him, looked into his eyes and saw the same thing. It was time, but lord was it ever too soon.  We love you, Edgar.
